## Usage

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShowerMan/Axis/refs/heads/main/Main.luau"))()
```

## Why Axis?

Most animation loggers out there are pretty bare-bones. They log animations, let you copy the ID, and that's about it. Axis takes it further.

| Feature | Axis | Other Loggers |
|---------|------|---------------|
| Animation logging | Yes | Yes |
| Copy animation ID | Yes | Yes |
| Copy as Roblox URL | Yes | No |
| Live 3D preview | Yes | No |
| Playback controls | Yes | No |
| Speed adjustment | Yes | No |
| Timeline seeking | Yes | No |
| Auto-preview mode | Yes | No |
| Modern UI | Yes | Varies |

The main thing that sets Axis apart is the preview panel. You can actually watch animations play on a clone of your character right in the UI, adjust the playback speed, pause it, scrub through the timeline - stuff you'd normally have to test in Studio.
